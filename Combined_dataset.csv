Widescreen Aspect Ratio  The monitor features a widescreen aspect ratio which allows you to more easily work with multiple documents and applications. The 16:10 screen also lets you more naturally view widescreen movies and work with HD video on the monitor.  High Contrast Ratio    The monitor features a high 1000:1 contrast ratio and brightness level of 300cd/m2, presenting bright and defined image quality.  Integrated Speakers  The display features integrated stereo speakers. This lets you use the space on your desk that would normally be taken up by bulky computer speakers for more useful items.  Small Footprint  The monitor's small footprint and ability to be wall or arm mounted helps conserve often-scarce space on your desk.  Dual Input  The monitor features both standard VGA input as well as digital HDMI input with HDCP. This allows it to be connected to virtually any modern computer.

This is a high quality casting of an early 1980's classic. I can't id the material but it looks a lot like concrete. I just haven't seen concrete castings of this quality or showing this much detail. You really need to see it in person. Truly a one of a kind piece for the hard core Macintosh fan/evangelist. Don't let this one slip past you. You may not see another one.    Sorry, no keyboard, mouse, boot disks, software, or cord. A little dirty, excellent condition. Only chip I could find is pictured below. Very heavy and as solid as the rock it is...    The following is the the story I pieced together from stories others have told me: If I've got something very wrong please email me and I'll attempt to correct my story for the next owner. I have no idea if any of it is true or not.  When the Macintosh was designed Apple had a model shop located in a building near DeAnza and I-280 in Cupertino. Apparently that shop at Apple could only make small parts so early design versions of cases were fabricated out of small pieces of plastic that were glues glued together in layers, similar to making model cars. It was only in the later phases of the case's design that molds were created and casting were struck. The story has it that the molds used in production were very precise and did wear out. Thinking is that new design changes also caused molds to be phased out. No one has offered any info as to who might have come upon the the pieces of mold used to create this casting and what modifications were needed to cast a concrete case verses the plastic ones. Rumor has it that after only making a couple concrete casting the mold would have been shot.  So, there may only have been two of them ever made.    Serious MAC inquiries only.  I'll take the ad down as soon as it sells, so no need to ask if it's still available. Come see it and pick it up in Santa Clara, off Walsh Ave, between Scott and Lafayette.

Computer,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sys/d/fairfax-apple-g4-17-powerbook-1ghz-dual/7685340372.html,"First-off, newer is not necessarily better (manure millennial mindset) I don't need the most current MacOS to be running to feel superior really, as I have the ""beast"" of both worlds encased in this A1013 17"" Powerbook G4, 128 SSD, 1GHz CD/DVD dual boot OS X Sorbet Leopard & OS 9 (thanks OS9lives).     No Chat GPT spoken here (outfox/buzz-off). I own a classic car as well as classic Powerbooks. This is a tried, tested and true Powerbook/Powerhouse and boy does it deliver!    This G4 Powerbook is loaded and has a ton of magic still left in it. Comes with installed and working image manipulation video/graphics FX/plugins tools galore for AE, PS, FCP + (which are all also installed).     Sorbet Leopard is quick to respond on this machine as far as a modified Tiger/Leopard-based OS system is concerned and is impressive to say the least. Over the years I've collected, traded, downloaded and actually bought LoL some of the coolest graphic enhanced software titles and plugins which I've painstakingly loaded on these two operating systems.     Listed below is what's on the OS 9 drive, Sorbet Leopard has the more modern tools installed starting with the Adobe CS collection which would include: Adobe inDesign, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop with various other 3rd party ""cool"" plugins. Corel Painter and Knockout II are also on here.    This machine was to be my personal creative art partner in crime however, I've moved on to another heavily modified G4 Powerbook and that's the only reason I'm selling this one. All of the hard work of finding, gathering and installing w/serial numbers has been done for you, no demos or lite versions here. To the right person this is a historic Graphix/video goldmine made exclusively for creating and manipulating imagery, photos, art, effects, FX and video [720x1080].     Yeah, some of the software titles can be obtained through various abandonware mines while others are scarce/rare which you can't even begin to find on ebay, Internet Archive, Macintosh Garden or anywhere else for that matter, (good luck).     If your into creating digital photography, illustration, fantasy and surrealism art or even, video motion graphics and don't want your imagery to look like every other kids on the block, then this ""beast"" is what you want to do your bidding, NOT some ""cloud subscription"" crap with an over inflated OS with software titles to match (oh brother). Enough with the dispensing of the bells, whistles and mindless candy, made with prices to gouge you NOT, inspire you.     Note: Photoshop CC can still read Photoshop PSD and TIFF files (layers included) just fine as well as PS classic and Live Picture TIFFs. Quicktime still reads Quicktime, Perian is loaded on PowerPC ""Sorbet"" side.    Machine overall isn't perfect and has some dings & scratches here and there, nothing to hamper it's performance. Battery still holds a charge but for not very long. Also, it will need a PRAM battery (still available)for date and time but the machine will still work regardless with an included Apple wall charger. It can get you on the Internet if need-be, just not all features will work. Also, as a bonus I'll include some of my own personal Photoshop, After Effects, Motion Graphics, Video/Film and art PDF library with other ""cool stuff"" as well!

We were going to restore and reuse this one, but we have now decided on going another route with data storage for the company, so this needs a good home.     I just purchased a new Crucial 1TB SSD so that I could reinstall the OS and resurrect the server; however, this was before we decided to go another route and upgrade all around. I can include that SSD if you’d like for a negotiable price. This is a $100 drive, so please consider that.     I also have the original Windows Server 2012 r2 install disc; we are the original owners of this as well and the product key has only been used on this server. I took a photo of that and included it in this post (but I concealed the product key intentionally).If you take it, great; use it on this server when you set it up and it’s all yours.    The monitor displaying the desktop you see in the photo is with a fresh install of that Windows Server 2012 r2, on the new SSD. If you don’t need the SSD or the operating system, I’ll wipe the server again and use them both for another project. If you need hard drives, I’m sure I could get you a few HDDs of at least 1TB each. Just let me know and we can work it all out.     If you inquire via e-mail, I will respond quickly — typically within a few hours max. Be sure to check your spam/junk folder for my reply.
